Now that Agile passed the early adopter stage, there are many companies interested in adopting it, and many practitioners interested in learning it. Yet those companies and practitioners without extensive Agile experience have a hard time evaluating what will bring them value and what not.

Many of the larger companies and novice practitioners look at the marketing from [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/), and they donâ€™t know if they can trust it or not. 

In this document members of the Agile community are collecting available information including on these marketing stories. 

Some practitioners have been there and know the difference between marketing and real stories, others know not only how things started yet also how things are going now.

The information collected here is to help decision-makers and novice practitioners make an informed decision.
