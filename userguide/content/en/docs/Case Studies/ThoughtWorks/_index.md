ThoughtWorks is a global technology company that has pioneered Lean and Agile.
After observing, between 2015 and 2021, several clients that had adopted [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/), ThoughtWorks advised against adopting [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/). 

These are some of the things they observed from the clients that had adopted [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/): [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) created friction in the organisational structure and its operating model, promoted silos, hindered tech from creating business capabilities, generated waste in the value stream and discouraged creativity, it limited autonomy and experimentation.
