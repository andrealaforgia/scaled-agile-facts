BlueDolphin consultant Wolfram MÃ¼ller together with a hub of other consultants including Steve Tendon has worked in recent years helping several organisations to deal with issues after they adopted [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/). 

They recently analysed the performance of teams from a company department of 200 software developers that have been working with Essential SAFe for 1.5 years. The result highlights the same problems typical of the traditional pre-Agile approaches.

There are no signs that Essential SAFe helped them increase their agility and improve.
