So far all the [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) case studies that allow for some form of verification or third-party observations all show that [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) does not make the organisation more agile, it worsened the shortcomings that are typical of the pre-Agile approaches, and overall makes things worse.

It is also known that [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) isnâ€™t used by any leading software commercial organisations such as Facebook, Google, Netflix, Microsoft, and the like.

This overall picture is congruent with the growing number of anecdotal evidence emerging from Sr leaders and employees sharing stories about their previous companies where [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) was adopted.
