Bob Galen became [SAFe framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) SPC certified around 2013. He tried to understand, support, and apply it, but then he struggled with it for a long time to the point that he just couldn’t be associated with it any longer.

In his farewell to [SAFe framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) he mentioned several reasons, here are a few: It’s too big; It creates far too many roles, layers, flows, etc; It’s too focused on certifications and training; It’s created lazy organisations who think the framework does the heavy lifting for them; It’s created a community of SPC’s and other consultants who look at every problem and thinks SAFe is the solution.
