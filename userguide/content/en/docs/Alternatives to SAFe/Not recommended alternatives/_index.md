All heavy-weight frameworks like [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/), that promise to scale Agile, have problems similar to or equivalent to SAFe.

All the canned solutions and standard recipes for Agile transformations, Digital transformations, and for Scaling Agile, coming from large consultancy firms, don’t work either.

All attempts to copy and paste solutions of other organisations, like trying to replicate the Spotify model, have also failed repeatedly.
Also, the attempts to extend or customise SAFe or other heavy-weight frameworks for a particular industrial sector, have failed.

Attempts to adopt Agile following one framework by the book, of running an Agile transformation using a Waterfall programme don’t work either.
