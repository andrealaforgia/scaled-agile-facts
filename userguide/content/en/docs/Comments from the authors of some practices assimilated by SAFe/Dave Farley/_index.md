Dave Farley is a pioneer of Continuous Delivery, an expert in DevOps, and co-author of the first and most relevant book on Continuous Delivery.

After working with several clients that have adopted it, he noted that [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) Release Trains practice is anti-Continuous Integration where Continuous Integration is a fundamental technical practice of Agile that Continuous Delivery is built on.
That means that Release Trains in SAFe are anti-Continuous Delivery.
