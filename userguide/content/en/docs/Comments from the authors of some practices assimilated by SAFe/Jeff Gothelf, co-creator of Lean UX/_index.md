Jeff Gothelf is the co-creator and co-author of Lean UX. He has direct experience with [SAFe framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) and indirect experience with several clients. 

Commenting on how [SAFe framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) and Lean UX works together he says “all the principles we’ve built into Lean UX don’t seem to exist in [SAFe framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/).”

Based on what his clients are being taught by their [SAFe framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) trainers/consultants they are unable to see how [SAFe framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) and Lean UX can mix together. Neither does he have any good answers for them, since deviating from the framework is considered heresy in most cases.
