description: co-creators of Scrum

Ken Schwaber and Jeff Sutherland are two of the creators of the Scrum, and co-authors of The Scrum Guide. They are also part of the group of authors of the Agile Manifesto.

They both criticise [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/), as detailed later in the document. 

Jeff Sutherland in particular says that [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) is inconsistent with the Scrum guide and codifies dysfunctions that can cripple teams for years.

Ken Schwaber says that there is a fundamental philosophical schism between Scrum and [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) because Scrum controls risk through empiricism while [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) tries to control risk through predictability.
