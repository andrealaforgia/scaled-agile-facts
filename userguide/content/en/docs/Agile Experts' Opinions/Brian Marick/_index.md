Brian Marick described [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) nature as problematic and prescriptive due to the set of rules to follow, with a fret to enforce them. And he also described [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) processes as overly-codified to the point that they actively work against the collective creation of tacit knowledge.
