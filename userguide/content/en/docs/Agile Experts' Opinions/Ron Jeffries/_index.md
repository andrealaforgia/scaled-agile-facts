Ron Jeffries published on his personal website a very constructive, detailed long list of criticisms about [SAFe framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/).
His criticisms have fallen on deaf ears, and instead, the latest versions of [SAFe framework](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) have even worsened the problems.
