Alistair Cockburn suggested that the money and time spent on installing [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) could produce much better results when spent instead on improving collaboration and delivery that in turn would move the company's attitude and behaviour some distance. 

He added at that point that he stopped defending SAFe because he thinks there is a better way to spend the money.
