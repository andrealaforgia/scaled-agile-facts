description: Watch Out, Waterfall Ahead! The Truth About SAFe
---

Paweł Huryn comments in his post on various aspects of [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/), where he notes that 
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) adopts a Waterfall approach to requirements
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) processes and roles show a lack of trust and autonomy of development teams
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) focus is on plans and output more than on outcomes and feedback
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) version of Scrum deviates from the real Scrum making it worse.
He concludes by suggesting that with [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) an organisation doesn't feel the need to change anything substantial, but with it, they feel they can call themselves “Agile.”
