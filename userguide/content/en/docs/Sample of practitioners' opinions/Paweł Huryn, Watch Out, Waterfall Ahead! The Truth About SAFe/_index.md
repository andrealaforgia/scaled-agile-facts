description: Watch Out, Waterfall Ahead! The Truth About SAFe
---

Paweł Huryn comments in his post on various aspects of [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/), where he notes that 
- SAFe adopts a Waterfall approach to requirements
- SAFe processes and roles show a lack of trust and autonomy of development teams
- SAFe focus is on plans and output more than on outcomes and feedback
- SAFe version of Scrum deviates from the real Scrum making it worse.
He concludes by suggesting that with SAFe an organisation doesn't feel the need to change anything substantial, but with it, they feel they can call themselves “Agile.”
