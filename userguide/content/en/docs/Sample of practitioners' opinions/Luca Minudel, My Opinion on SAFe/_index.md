description: My Opinion on SAFe
---

Luca Minudel analyses various aspects of the framework and comments on their practical implications noting that:
- The 12-step [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) Implementation Roadmap is like a 1-size-fits-all Waterfall programme 
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) Budgeting and Portfolio management donâ€™t solve the problems of annual budgeting
  and planning due to the prescriptive, top-down, rigid nature of most [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) implementations 
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) Requirements Model is a pre-Agile deliverable-oriented hierarchical decomposition 
  of the work mirroring the hierarchy of the roles in [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/), it reinforces a top-down approach
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) Roles add more bureaucracy, disempower the teams, and make collaboration harder
- PI Planning hinders business-tech collaboration, accommodates dependencies instead of 
  removing them, and perpetuates a top-down pre-Agile approach
- Release Trains is a very inefficient pre-Agile practice inferior to all the modern alternatives
- Overly complicated [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) contradicts the Agile principle of simplicity and emergence
  Following his observations, he concludes that [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) violates all four Agile values.
