description: SAFe&colon; A Waterfall Pig with Agile Lipstick

Sam Haynes, based on his observations of [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) implementations thinks that:
- SAFe’s ask for excessive time to developers for estimations and metrics is demotivating
- SAFe requirement of starting by getting everyone SAFe trained and certified is suspicious
- SAFe “branded agile” risk to discredit genuine Agile
- PI Planning tries to manage dependencies instead of having a loosely coupled architecture
- PI Planning cadence doesn't allow to timely react/adapt to changing customer needs
- PI Planning and Release Trains are inferior to on-demand planning and Continuous Delivery.
He wonders why anyone with a genuine Agile mindset would be using SAFe in the first place.
