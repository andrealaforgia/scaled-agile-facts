Kevin Bendeler after working several years with [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) comments on 7 flaws he noticed in the framework’s adoption:
- In [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) extensive front-loaded planning encourages ineffective larger batch size work
- Technical debt tends to increase in [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) organisations
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) Program Increment (PI) cycle time is unfit for teams that need to be responsive
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) roles and structure may discourage teams collaboration that’s an Agile value
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) approaches to estimation is more predictive than empirical as in Agile
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) focus more on output and volume than the value created and delivered
- [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) doesn’t have enough focus on the feedback loop and related learnings.
He concludes by saying he thinks that trying to scale Agile up by applying heavyweight, top-down methodologies is antithetical and counterproductive.
