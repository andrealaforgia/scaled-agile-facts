This content is a collective effort with multiple contributions, mainly from the Agile community. The list is long. 

They are the experts and the practitioners mentioned below whose posts and articles have been linked in [Sources](../docs/sources), the many readers that suggested several improvements, those who worked on the case studies, and the facilitators of this effort, XX and YY.
