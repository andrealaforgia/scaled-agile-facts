Steve Denning is a recognised expert and author in leadership, management, and innovation. 

In some of his articles, he describes the efforts to scale Agile with [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) as counterproductive. He further criticises [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) stating that it destroys the very essence of Agile, and it degrades and undermines everything in Agile that is authentic and useful.

He added that [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) gives to organisations a mandate to call themselves Agile while keep doing what they have always done, reaching the conclusion that [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) is the epitome of fake Agile.
