Steve Denning is a recognised expert and author in leadership, management, and innovation. 

In some of his articles, he describes the efforts to scale Agile with [SAFe](https://www.scaledagileframework.com/) as counterproductive. He further criticises SAFe stating that it destroys the very essence of Agile, and it degrades and undermines everything in Agile that is authentic and useful.

He added that SAFe gives to organisations a mandate to call themselves Agile while keep doing what they have always done, reaching the conclusion that SAFe is the epitome of fake Agile.
