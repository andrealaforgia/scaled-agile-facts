David John Snowden is a researcher in the field of knowledge management, and the creator of the Cynefin framework applied in software development and management science.

Overall he expressed a very negative view of SAFe.
Among other comments, he explained that SAFe employs ordered world approaches to solve complex problems, and because of that itâ€™s a-priori wrong. As a result, he adds, SAFe is a massive backwards not a forwards move.
